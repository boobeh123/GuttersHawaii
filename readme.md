📅 **Release Date:** July 28th, 2025

## 📢 Developer's Notes - **Add contact form w/ functionality**

- While this website is not a 1-to-1 replica of Windows Hawaii's website, there are similarities from the layout that I followed. If the customer wants pixel perfect, then that can be done too

## 📢 Developer's Notes - **Initial commit**

- The business owner asked if I could design his website to look like Windows Hawaii's website
    - I consider the layout to be outdated, but this build reminds me of the Style's Conference web page I built when I was learning HTML & CSS
